                    <img src="paris.jpg" alt="Eiffel Tower in Paris" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" />
                    <p>Experience the romance of the City of Lights. Stroll along the Seine, visit the iconic Eiffel Tower, and indulge in exquisite French cuisine at charming bistros.
                        Paris is the capital of the country of France. It has long been one of western Europe's major centers of culture and business. 
                        Some of the world's greatest artists, writers, scholars, fashion designers, and chefs have lived in Paris.
                        Paris is monumental, in terms of its size of course, but also its rich architectural heritage! One of the symbols of the capital, its most famous monument is of course the Eiffel Tower.
                         This unique “Iron Lady” offers visitors unrivalled views. Not far away is the equally emblematic Arc de Triomphe.
                         Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centers of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy.
                          Because of its leading role in the arts and sciences and its early adaptation of extensive street lighting, 
                         it became known as the City of Light in the 19th century.

                    <h3>Tokyo</h3>
                    <img src="Tokyo.jpg" alt="Tokyo skyline" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" />
                    <p>Discover the vibrant culture and technology of Japan. From the bustling streets of Shibuya to the serene gardens of the Imperial Palace, Tokyo offers a unique blend of tradition and modernity.
                        It is the country's largest city and is located in east-central Honshu at the head of Tokyo Bay. 
                        The site has been inhabited since ancient times. The small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries before it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603,
                         at the start of the Edo (Tokugawa) period. Tokyo is Japan's major cultural center.
                          Displays depicting the art and history of Japan and Asia are featured at the Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park.
                          Ueno Park is also the site of a science museum, a zoological garden, and two major art museums.

                    <h3>New York</h3>
                    <img src="newyork.jpeg" alt="Times Square in New York" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;" />
                    <p>Visit the city that never sleeps. Experience the energy of Times Square, take a walk in Central Park, and enjoy world-class entertainment on Broadway.
                        Most travelers recommend visiting the area after dark to see the marquee displays. Many add checking out Times Square before or after a Broadway show is the perfect time to fit it into your schedule. However, if you're not a fan of crowds, reviewers suggest you avoid this area altogether.

                        Times Square's biggest tourist draw is the annual New Year's Eve ball drop. 
                        Revelers crowd the area to see New York's famous Waterford crystal ball descend 77 feet from a pole on the One Times Square building.
                         If you're feeling brave, take a trip to New York and Times Square at this time of year and watch the ball drop for free!
                          Just plan on coming in the early morning and staying all day, 
                        and note that the area is super crowded, even by New York standards.
